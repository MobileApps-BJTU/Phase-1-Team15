    
    Nowadays, more and more people own smart phones and they are eager to take photos.What's 

more, some photos that they took are of high quality and can do earn money by selling them. 


    However, there is not a existing platform for common users to sell their original photos.
    
Therefore, we plan to develop the application named 'ShaiPai'.'Shan' means 'å–„' in Chinese, 

it not only means being good at something, but also means charity. What's more, 'Pai' means 

auction and taking photos. So, our application is a charity social platform with some 

partial functions of e-commerce.It can not only share the photos that we like, but also can 

donate some money to foundations.

  
  The target users are people who 
    
  have a smart phone
  
  like taking photos and
  
  are willing to help others.
